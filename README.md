#### THE TASK AT HAND:... 
Use Visual Studios to convert numbers to the word equivalent, October 01, 2020_

#### By _**Sakeena Ali**_

## What was the Challenge?

_To create a class, within which we use a method, that will allow  any integer value from 1-999 and convert said  value to its word equivalent. furthermore, this is to be done, without using inbuilt features in VS._

## How I expected the challenge to go.
_Primarily it seems a straightforward task, and it actually is, if you have had the chance to learn C# for a minimum of 3 months, it can be done with ease. 
\
However... I have had only 10 days of what is essentially a crash course in this area, and if your anything like me, and C# is the equivalent of being given a HGV vehicle, without any lessons, and you only have ever driven a 1 1itre Fiat Punto. And then being told, "here are the keys to said HGV, and take it on the M40 at 90 miles per hour".... we all know how that is probably not a good idea... to put it bluntly, I didnt have the greatest of hopes, but im a trier!

However all hypothetical sitations aside, I have been lucky to be in a position in which all lessons are recorded, and have ample material to sift through, and with video demonstrations of coding, you can gage how the code can be implemented. 



## what went well
Once I wrote the code from how we were taught by the trainer, this was itself an easy task. BUT! I had made some minor errors, by referring back to the video material, and asking for help from those available, plus with the trainer at hand, the code finally worked. I also took the oppurtunity to ask the trainer, what various aspects of the codes meant, what the functions actually do. I dont want to just be someone who inputs symbols, and be done with the results, for me learning is knowing and being able to explain what you are being asked to do. 

## what didnt go as planned?

I wanted to do another stretch goal of numbers up to 10000, I wanted to push myself, however this requires a slightly different way of thinking, and a little more time. I also dont do myself any favours, I get a little over confident, and think I can take a swim in the Atlantic, when having just mastered swimming 10 meters. Its doable, but I need a bit more time, thus its not possible to do this by a 3'0 clock deadline. (Also I am referring to C# here, I have no intention of ever jumping into the Atlantic sea!).

## Possible improvements for future challenges

I can think of 3 aspects that would improve future challenges:

1) Do not be afraid to ask questions, no matter how detail oriented they are,

2) practice alot more.

3) I need some idea of what specific area of a coding programme I will be looking at for the night before, so I can do some swotting and allow myself the time to process information, as we are not stupid machines, but people with ðŸ§   where information takes a little longer to process.
